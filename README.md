This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the repo running locally for the first time:
clone the repo into a local folder then run `npm install` and `npm run dev`

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarahhling/sffuncheap-redesign.git
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Also deployed here: https://sffuncheap-redesign.vercel.app/

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
